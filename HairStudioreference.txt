This is a reference sheet for Jayme's template website HairStudio.com
requirements (follow this link for more https://www.eukhost.com/blog/webhosting/7-features-every-hair-salon-website-needs/): 
o Mobile-friendly design
    - most people will be viewing our website from their phone and this is an important aspect that we need to face for this project

o High-quality gallery
    - because this is a hair salon and the product is a service we need to show this well
    - for purposes of this project we'll be using 

o Online booking 
    - this is important because this is how the hair stylist will make money and secure their appointment
    - because we are learning about fornt end development we will try to make our own check out page
    - there are many ways to excute a booking/checkout page no matter what the boomming page needs:
        o show the stylist avalibality (usually on a calender)
        o show cost and avalibale hair styles
        o the salons phone number

web site references (here is a link of all the "best" salons in pittsburgh https://www.expertise.com/pa/pittsburgh/hair-salons):
o http://salonivy.net/ 
    - this website has a lot it can improved upon. the layout is basic, pictures used are grainy and the nav bar is not user friendly at anything lass then 767px wide
    - good for reference as far as content but the actuall website needs a lot of work
    - also this page is not responisve for phone or tablet view

o https://www.alchemydrycutlounge.com/ 
    - good use of JavaScript.
    - responsive web page with a good nav bar 
    - some links to the nav bar go to other tabs but this is in general a good web site

o https://bloominhair.com/ 
    - very good website design
    - doesnt break at any viewport
    - good nav bar
    - almost looks better on a phone 
    - good use of pictures
    - this is a small website that has only 5 pages. this is a great example of a small, professonal, well thought out website

o https://www.cardamonessalon.net/
    - this website has a great layout and generally shows what we need for the hair salon website
    - its not very responisve. the website breaks at many view points that not a laptop 
    - this is really good for a reference

o https://deanofshadyside.com/ 
    - this is another good basic hair salon website. this is a great example of the tyoe of webstie we want to be able to make/design
    - the website as a whole is really good with a responsive design and alomst none of the elements break. 
    - the nav bar is constant and has a mobile and desktop design. the nav breaks on some pages so there is an argument for consticney for the nav 
    but the design of the navigatioin is really good
    - I think they developer used a grid layout for this webpages design. when switching between mobile and desktop
    I noticed that the images would move to different parts of the webpage at different viewports
    - after going though these hair salon pages i noticed that most of the home, contact, and about pages are relatively similar with a 
    short description, few images, a button to schedule an appointment and a google maps section to show where the salon is with a link to the address in google maps
    - also intrestingly i did not expect hair salons to have their own blogs and articles, so some salon websites have a whole section for these blogs

These are the links needed to use BootStrap. BootStrap is a framework in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. this allows us to make webpages way faster because
there are alot of predefined classes and functions in the framework. we work faster because we do not have to make classes, just have to read and understand documentation.
we can add our own styles but becareful that the custom styles do not conflict with BootStrap because it will led to bugs.
these are the links needed to use the newest version of BootStrap:
