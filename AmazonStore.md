Because Jayme’s is selling less then 40 items a month we’ll only need the standard plan that cost 0.99$ a month.

## Track what your sell and customers
We can also use an app to check and track our sales and customers in the Amazon store. It is available in the Apple Store and the google play store. This is the link to the app →  https://sell.amazon.com/blog/how-to-use-amazon-seller-app

<br />

## How to list products
<br />
To sell on Amazon we have to list our product, this is called a product listing. Because Jayme’s is an individual seller and our customers are most likely not buying wigs and supplies in bulk we are going to list our products one at a time. Amazon is really useful because we can sell to both businesses and customers. This allows scalability and growth in Jayme’s business, meaning we can eventually become a vendor that can sell in bulk when the business grows bigger. We can do this on Amazon without additional fees being applied. The listing on Amazon is important because a Successful listing = successful launch. Also, we are reselling hair, which means we are not adding new items to Amazon and this honestly makes it easier to sell. It gives us credibility and most of the work registering the product is already done for us. Below are 2 images of what we need to make a good listing page

## Product detail page

<br />

The product detail page is where you go to buy the product and have in-depth information about the item you are selling. When multiple sellers offer the same product, Amazon combines data from all the offers into one product detail page. Even though we are using information from Amazon and other vendors we can still request to change information on the page if it’s not correct. On the detail page, you want to answer a question the customers may have and help them make the best decision to buy the product they need. Making your listings concise, accurate, and easy to understand to make the ultimate customer experience. Below is an image of tips for making a good product detail page.

## How to deliver products
<br />


When it comes to delivering products to customers on Amazon we have 2 options: 
O Give your products to Amazon and let them handle and ship your products which includes a fee. This is handled through the Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)
O maintain your own inventory and shipping products to customers (merchant-fulfillment). This is way cheaper

We’ll be shipping the product to customers ourselves because its cheaper and Amazon will charge you more fees if you use the FBA service. Amazon charges shipping rates based on the product category and shipping service selected by the customer, then passes the amount on to you in the form of a shipping credit. 

All products that we ship will have a shipping rate on an individual plan (because it's cheaper and this is how Amazon gets their money back by making the individual plan so cheap and taxing you on every product you sell). It is important that we price an affordable product for the customers but also make enough money off it to make it worth our while. Amazon has a buy shipping tool that will help sellers like Jayme’s get better deals because we are basically becoming vendors and making money with Amazon. This tool will give us deals on a trusted network of shipping partners, ship and confirm your orders, and track your shipments.

## The First Sale

<br />


The first sale is the biggest milestone because that basically means that your store works and we making money off this. After this, we are maintaining the store, looking to improve customer retainability, and overall improving the business and making more money. We can keep tabs on important metrics by using the Seller Central App. Below is an image of important metrics to keep track of for your Amazon store.

Lastly, customer reviews are the most important metric to measure because it literally tells you how good or bad your business is doing, projects how your sales and display where we can implore in the business. Customer reviews benefit both sellers and buyers. Bad reviews are off-putting and make it hard to attract new customers and in general bad for business. Good reviews will tell you what you’re doing good at and brings new customers and helps keeps the customers you have right now. For more information about reviews, sales, and overall improving the Amazon store Amazon has a Seller University on youtube. The youtube channel has step-by-step guides, tutorials, and training to help entrepreneurs start (and grow) their Amazon business.

We can get creative by using coupons, promotions, and ads. Firstly, Amazon has 3 ways to advertise which are all accessible through the Seller Central App :
